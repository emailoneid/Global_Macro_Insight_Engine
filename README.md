## 🚀 What This Is

A unified AI-powered macroeconomic dashboard that solves a messy reality: **data is scattered, hard to clean, and harder to interpret**. Governments and institutions publish thousands of economic indicators, but none tell a complete story.

**Macro Trends Dashboard** brings those fragments together. It combines structured pipelines with Gemini LLM to extract meaning, spot second-order patterns, and turn economic noise into clarity.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

* 📂 **Too many sources** — World Bank, IMF, ECOS, DAPA, SIPRI, etc.
* 🧩 **Inconsistent formats** — different units, columns, and structures
* ⏳ **Slow pattern recognition** — time lost in spreadsheets
* ❌ **Missed signals** — second-order effects are rarely visible
* 🔒 **Hard to reuse** — datasets lack a shared schema

---

## ⚙️ The Solution

* 🔗 **Unifies 7 sectors** — 92 indicators, 160K+ records into 1 view
* 🧠 **Uses LLMs** — AI generates summaries, risks, and strategic calls
* 📊 **Interactive dashboards** — explore, drill down, download
* ⚡ **Insight-first** — no data science background required

---

## 🚀 What It Does

* Collects macro, trade, energy, defense, and industrial data
* Cleans and standardizes into a unified PostgreSQL schema
* Uses Gemini LLM for trend analysis, risk flags, and insight generation
* Visualizes key indicators through sector dashboards

---

## 🧠 Features

* 🤖 **AI Insight Engine** — LLM-powered interpretations
* 🌐 **7 Sector Dashboards** — macro to micro
* 📊 **160K+ Records** — from 20+ global institutions
* 🎛️ **Custom Filters & Visuals** — dual-axis, volatility, momentum
* 🧾 **Downloadable Tables** — export filtered views instantly
