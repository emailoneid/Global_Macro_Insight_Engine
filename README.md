An AI-powered dashboard built to solve a real problem:  
**economic data is scattered, overwhelming, and hard to interpret.**  
Governments, institutions, and agencies publish thousands of indicators — but no single tool makes sense of them all.

**Macro Trends Dashboard unifies fragmented macroeconomic, trade, energy, and defense data**, then uses LLMs to extract meaning, spot second-order trends, and turn noise into actionable insight — all in one place.
